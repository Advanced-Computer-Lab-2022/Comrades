## Motivation

The project was built as a capstone for "Advanced Computer Lab" Course at the GUC.
The idea was to offer Intersting and helpfull courses to any body who want to develop his skills.
You can Easily watch your lessons, solve exercises and reieve your certificate after finishing your course without any need to schools or colleges.  

## Build status

The Code is in Perfect Status as we invested a lot of time in erros solving and explainning our functions and concepts which makes
 it too easy for other developers to edit 
 the code and reshape it in the way they are willing too.



## Code Style
We used camelCase for variables.

Codes are formatted in VS Code using alt + shift + F.

Indentation was used to assist in identifying control flow and blocks of code.

Curley braces are used except for the case where the body of the loop/conditional statement is a single code.

Spaces are not used rather than tabs.
